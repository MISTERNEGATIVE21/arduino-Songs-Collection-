# Arduino 8-Bit Music Generator

## Overview

This Arduino project is a simple 8-bit music generator that plays a basic melody using a piezo buzzer or a speaker connected to one of the digital pins on the Arduino board.

## Hardware Setup

Connect a piezo buzzer or a speaker to the designated digital pin on your Arduino. Make sure to connect the positive (anode) pin to the chosen digital pin and the negative (cathode) pin to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Adjust the `buzzerPin` variable in the sketch to match the digital pin to which you connected the buzzer/speaker.
3. Run the sketch on your Arduino.

The provided example code plays a 440 Hz tone (A4 note) for 1 second and then stops the tone for 0.5 seconds. Feel free to modify the code to generate different melodies or frequencies.
